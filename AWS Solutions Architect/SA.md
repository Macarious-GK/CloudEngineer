## AWS 2-13 Securing AWS Environment

### Identity federation
- A system of trust between two parties to authenticate users single time with one creds
    - `Identity provider (IdP)` is responsible for user authentication.
    - `Service provider (SP)` is responsible for controlling access to its resources.
- `How it works`:
    1. User try to login to Service Provider (Social media platform)
    2. The SP redirect the user to Identity provider (Google)
    3. The Idp authenticates the user & Create Token & return it to SP
    4. The SP uses this token to verify identity and grant access.
- AWS services that support identity federation
    - AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
    - AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)
    - Security Token Service (AWS STS)
        - provides temporary AWS credentials.
        - Uses AssumeRole operation of the AWS STS API for cross-account access or for federation.
        - response to Identity Broker to give temp creds 
    - Amazon Cognito

    - traffic routing, and DNS health checks.
- `Route 53 with ELB`:
    - ELB DNS Name – AWS assigns a hostname that resolves to ELB IPs.
    - Use Route 53 alias records or a CNAME to map your domain to the ELB.
- > CNAME VS Alias act as A record
    - For `apex domain` or `root domain` we Use Alias or ***A Record***:
        - macarious.com -> 1.1.1.1 -or- macarious -> endpoint of S3/ELB
    - For resolving `subdomains` we Use ***CNAME***:
        - dev.macarious.com -> myapp.macarious.com 

- Provide `Global Traffic Management` Policies:
    - ***Simple routing policy***: for a single resource.
    - ***Weighted routing policy***: route traffic to multiple resources in defined weights
    - ***Latency routing policy***: Use when you have resources in multiple AWS Regions and you want to route traffic to the Region that provides the lowest latency.
    - ***Failover routing policy***: Use when you want to configure active-passive failover.
    - ***Geolocation routing policy***: route traffic based on the location of your users.
    - ***Geoproximity routing policy***: route traffic based on the physical distance between users and resources.
    - ***Multivalue answer routing policy***: Use when you want Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records that are selected at random.
    - ***IP-based routing policy***: route traffic based on the location of your users and have the IP addresses that the traffic originates from.
- `Route 53 and the blue/green deployment`:
    - ***A/B Testing***: You can use weighted routing to test different versions of your app.
    - ***Canary Releases***: You can release new features or updates to a small subset of your users first, and then gradually roll them out to the rest of your users.
