## Notes:
- An Azure RBAC role is applied to a scope, which is a resource or set of resources that the access applies to. Resource locks prevent the accidental change or deletion of a resource. Resource tags are used to locate and act on resources associated with specific workloads, environments, business units, and owners. Policies enforce different rules across resource configurations so that the configurations stay compliant with corporate standards.
- We can deallocate VMs that will not be used in certain time 
- After an outage, Service Health provides official incident reports called root cause analysis (RCA), which you can share with stakeholders.
- A resource is a manageable item that is available through Azure. Virtual machines, storage accounts, web apps, databases, and virtual networks are examples of resources.
- Region pairs allow the replication of Azure resources across geographies to help ensure that a secondary region is available in case of any disaster at the primary region.
- Elasticity refers to the ability to scale resources as needed, such as during business hours, to ensure that an application can keep up with demand, and then reducing the available resources during off-peak hours. Agility refers to the ability to deploy new applications and services quickly. High availability refers to the ability to ensure that a service or application remains available in the event of a failure. Geo-distribution makes a service or application available in multiple geographic locations that are typically close to your users.
- The just-in-time (JIT) access feature in Microsoft Defender for Cloud allows you to lock down inbound traffic to your Azure Virtual Machines. This reduces exposure to attacks while providing easy access when you need to connect to a VM
